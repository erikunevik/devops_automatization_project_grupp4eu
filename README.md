# Weather App DevOps Pipeline

This repository contains a simple weather application covering the weather in Stockholm, Göteborg and Malmö for the past 24 hours - along with a CI/CD pipeline implemented using GitHub Actions. The pipeline automates testing and Docker image building and pushing.


All the best / Erik
